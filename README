=amazon-ses 
A gem for interfacing with Amazon's Simple Email Service

==Features:
Currently you can:
* Send a basic raw text email.
* Send email with a .erb template 


==How does it work:

1. First make sure you validate the email that you are going to use in the "from" section of the email.

2. Build Email:

* Raw email without a .erb template:
You can achieve this by NOT specifying a :template in your options:

options = {
  :from => 'email@gmail.com', 
  :to => 'email@gmail.com', 
  :subject => 'Testing', 
  :body => 'THis is a test', 
  :aws_access_key => 'your acess key', 
  :aws_secret_key => 'your secret key'
}

e = AmazonEmail.new(options) 

* Email that will use a .erb template:
You can achieve this by specifying the location of you .erb file in the :template option:

options_2 = { 
:from => 'noreply@setlr.com', 
:to => 'gcarlos1@gmail.com', 
:subject => 'This is the subject of the email',  
:aws_access_key => "access_key_id",
:aws_secret_key => "secret_access_key",
:template => File.new("sample_email.erb").read
}



3. Send it

e.send


== Install:

* sudo gem install amazon-ses
