Amazon-ses is a gem that will allow you to interact with Amazon's Simple Email Service:

Right now, there is only one thing you can do and that is, send a text email to a single user.

How does it work:

1. First make sure you validate the email that you are going to use in the "from" section of the email.

2. Then build an emial:

options = {:from => 'email@gmail.com', :to => 'email@gmail.com', :subject => 'Testing', :body => 'THis is a test', :aws_access_key => 'your acess key', :aws_secret_key => 'your secret key'}

e = AmazonEmail.new(options) 


3. Send it

e.send
